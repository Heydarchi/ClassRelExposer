# ClassRelExposer
The aim of this python project is to find and exposing the class relationship

### The supported languages are:
- C++
- Java 
- CSharp (C#)

<br/>

The code is tested for Java but not that much for C++ and C-Sharp. Of course, it is not completed yet and has some flaws and issues in processing. Very welcome to report or any kind of contribution.

Feel free to create a ticket or send me a message/report.
